I've also attached a link to my docker repository: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/samr99/geodjango_tutorial_image/general
# Features
- User Authentication: Signup, login, and logout functionality
- Geolocation: Users can update their location and view nearby tennis courts.
- Tennis Data: Displays tennis courts from a GeoJSON file with details like name and address.
- Interactive Map: Utilises Leaflet for map rendering with markers for hospitals and user location.
- Creating, Manipulating and Storing Spatial Data: I am able to create, manipulate, and store data in my django admin page.
- Search Functionality: Users are able to search for specific tennis courts.
- Find Closest Tennis Court: Users are told their closest tennis court and can clikc to get a route to that court.
- Subcategory Filtering: Users can filter tennis courts by subcategories (private or public courts).
- Route Finding: Users can click on a hospital marker and a pop up will appear with the option to find the fastest route. (2 options per court).
- Favouriting: Users can favourite specific tennis courts and filter by only showing the ones they favourited.

# Tech Stack
- Backend: Django with Django Templates to handle server-side logic.
- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for storing and managing geospatial data.
- Database Management: PgAdmin 4 for database management and monitoring.
- Mapping: Leaflet JS and OpenStreetMap for displaying interactive maps with precise user location tracking.
- Containerisation & Deployment: Docker for application containerisation and AWS for hosting.

# Creating Docker Containers, Dockerising Containers, and Using AWS Cloud Services (Locally and Deployed):
## Steps For Local Setup Before Deployment:

After creating the project app, I created an environment called **awm_env** and activated it using these commands:
```
conda create -n awm_env python=3.12
conda activate awm_env
```

I then installed all the necessary libraries, configured my settings.py correctly, applied all the necesssary migrations, imported all the data, and created the **static** files here are some of the commands I used to do this:
```
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py shell

# When in the shell terminal I ran these commands to import all the data
from world import load
load.run()

from tennis import load
load.run()
```

I then created a **dockerfile** and a **docker-compose.yml** file. The dockerfile is a script reponsible for giving instructions on building a docker image. The docker-compose.yml is used to define and run multi-container applications such as my django web application.

This file provides the instructions to build a Docker image for the Django application. It specifies the base image, installs necessary dependencies, copies application files, and defines commands to run the app. The Dockerfile ensures a consistent environment for the Django application, including specific libraries and configurations for deployment.

This configuration ensures that Nginx correctly serves your Django application and static assets, handling incoming requests efficiently.

I also created an **ENV.yml** file by running this command (made some modifications in the file):
```
conda env export --from-hisory > ENV.yml
```

I used the following commands to build the images for my project:
```
docker build -t geodjango_tutorial_image .
```
I used the following command to compose up and create all the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file:
```
docker-compose up
```
## Steps For Deployment Setup After Local Setup:
After coding and creating all the app's functionality (app functionality will be discussed further down in the readme), and testing that everything is running and working smoothly on my localhost, I started the deployment process. I first created a docker repository to store my app's image (linked above), so that I could push and pull the latest image.

I started by rebuilding the images by using this command:
```
docker build -t samr99/geodjango_tutorial_image:latest .
```
Then I pushed the built the images onto the docker repository by using this command:
```
docker push samr99/geodjango_tutorial_image:latest
```
After pushing the latest version of the images to the docker repository, I created an instance using AWS cloud services and connected to it.

### Steps For AWS:
After creating an **EC2** instance on AWS, I got the public IP address and created an **A record** configuration for the DNS of my domain (I manage my DNS configurations on my account on, here is the website link: https://www.godaddy.com/en-ie). I then started and connect to the instance. 

* **Step 1:** After connecting, I created a docker network by running this command:
```
docker network create wmap_network
```
* **Step 2:** I created a **dockerfile** using this command:
```
sudo nano Dockerfile
```
* **Step 3:** I then pulled my images from my docker repository using this command:
```
docker pull samr99/geodjango_tutorial_image:latest
```
* **Step 4:** After pulling the images, I created the four containers (**pgadmin**, **postgis**, **nginx**, and **awm_django_app**) essential for deploying my web application, I then started all the containers, here are the commands I used:
```
sudo docker create --name pgadmin4 --network wmap_network --network-alias pgadmin4 -t -v wmap_pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=c21373633@tudublin.ie' -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password123' dpage/pgadmin4

sudo docker create --name postgis --network wmap_network --network-alias postgis -t -v postgis_data:/var/lib/postgresql -e 'POSTGRES_USER=docker' -e 'POSTGRES_PASS=docker' kartoza/postgis

sudo docker create --name nginx --network wmap_network --network-alias nginx -p 84:80 -p 443:443 -t -v wmap_web_data:/usr/share/nginx/html -v $HOME/nginx/conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt -v /var/www/certbot nginx:latest

sudo docker create --name awm_django_app --network wmap_network --network-alias awm_django_app -t -v html_data:/usr/src/app/static c21373633/geodjango_tutorial_image:latest

docker start <container_id>
```
* **Step 5:** I then used **Certbot** to get an SSL/TLS cert, this is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS, I did this by running these commands and entering the necessary information:
```
docker exec -it nginx /bin/bash

certbot certonly --nginx
```
* **Step 6:** I then configured my **Nginx Proxy** by going into my nginx/conf directory (in AWS) and creating two files called **headers.conf** (used to define HTTP headers that Nginx will add to responses) and **server.conf** (contains the main server block configuration for Nginx, it defines how Nginx handles incoming requests), I used these commands to create the files:
```
sudo nano headers.conf

sudo nano server.conf
```

* **Step 7:** After all these steps, I restarted all the containers and tested out my project:
```
docker retart <container_id>
```

# Conclusion
This Advanced Web Mapping project effectively showcases the powerful integration of Django for spatial data management with a Docker-based deployment, enabling a dynamic, interactive application for geographic data exploration. With features such as user authentication, geolocation and Leaflet-powered interactive maps, the project offers a practical solution for locating tennis courts across Dublin. Supported by Docker and AWS, the deployment process is designed to be both stable and scalable, enhancing the app's overall user experience
